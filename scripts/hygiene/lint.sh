# Targets temporarily skipped because they use a language feature newer than
# the BUILDER-bundled bnlint (a BUILDER_VERSION snapshot) can typecheck — such
# source aborts at the typecheck pass before any lint rule runs.  bnlint
# typechecks dependency BODIES, so a skip must cover the whole transitive
# importer chain of the offending source, not just the file that names the
# feature.  Skipped targets stay fully type-checked and compiled by every
# conformance mode — only bnlint's style rules are paused.
#
# Currently skipping pkg/binate/vm + its importers (pkg/binate/repl, cmd/bni):
# vm imports pkg/builtins/rt, whose Exit/RawFree call C exit/free via the void
# __c_call spelling (e.g. `__c_call("free", "void", ptr)`) — a parser feature
# newer than the BUILDER-bundled bnlint (bnc-0.0.9), which aborts at the
# typecheck pass on it.  Remove once BUILDER_VERSION ships a bnlint that parses
# the "void" __c_call return spelling (tracked in claude-todo.md).
